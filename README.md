# Store IT (Early development)
Store IT is an aggregated free cloud storage web application, using pre-existing free cloud storage services, such as:
* Dropbox
* Google Drive
* One Drive

It is intended that a user can sign up and link there accounts that they have for these services and have all the free storage that is offered to them in one place.
